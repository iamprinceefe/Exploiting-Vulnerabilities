<h1>Exploiting Vulnerabilities: A Comprehensive Approach with Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit</h1>


<h2>Disclaimer !</h2>
This project is for educational purposes only. It is intended to demonstrate the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities using Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit within a controlled environment. Unauthorized use of these techniques on systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization before conducting any security assessments or penetration tests.



<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates a comprehensive security assessment workflow involving vulnerability scanning and exploitation. The steps include:

1. **Scanning**: Utilized Nmap and Nessus to perform detailed vulnerability scans on a Metasploit2 instance, identifying potential security weaknesses.
2. **Exploitation**: Leveraged msfconsole within the Metasploit framework to exploit identified vulnerabilities, showcasing practical penetration testing techniques.

The repository includes all relevant scan reports, and exploitation steps, providing a hands-on example of the vulnerability management lifecycle and practical exploitation methods.

<br />
<br />
Conducted another Nessus scan to discover and confirm the vulnerability for exploitation. Chose "UnreallRcd Backdoor Detection" for exploitation: <br/>
